    Once instantiated the root node,
    I need to expand it creating the childs.

    How create the childs?
    INstantianting other nodes.

    These nodes must be associated with the action
    that created them. So, before creating the child,
    I have to select the action

    How can I select the action?
    Starting from the node to expand, the action
    is selected randomlyself.

    So, I select randomly an action in order to
    expand the tree.

    NOw, with the action, i fed into the simulator Ã¹
    retrieving the state and reward.

    Now, I have the info, for creating another nodeself.

    Next, the node is associated with the parent node, using
    the action that created it. Then, I repeat the process.

    '''
    def predict(self, state):
        root_node=Node(state, self.num_actions, 0)

        #make 10 rollouts to create node's value
        for i in range(10):
            print('Rollout', i+1)
            root_node.selectChild()
            print('\n')

        #Pick the node with high value and return the action
